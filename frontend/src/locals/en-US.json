        "line3": "Family Y included four individuals with prelingual, bilateral, severe to profound hearing loss. All were homozygous at markers D7S496 and D7S2459, which flank pendrin (Figure 1C). In Family Y, the lod score for linkage of hearing loss to the D7S496-D7S2459 haplotype was 2.11, close to the maximum lod score possible in this family. We sequenced pendrin in an affected child from family Y and identified 716T>A in exon 6, which causes a substitution of aspartic acid for valine at amino acid 239 (V239D). All relatives were genotyped for this mutation: all four affected individuals were homozygous for V239D and all hearing individuals were either heterozygous or wild-type.",
        "line4": "Mutations in pendrin can cause either non-syndromic hearing loss or Pendred syndrome,[6] which, in addition to sensorineural hearing loss, includes thyroid enlargement (goitre) and temporal bone abnormalities of the inner ear, ranging from isolated enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA) to Mondini dysplasia--a complex malformation of the cochlear spiral [21]. Therefore, we evaluated the temporal bones of the affected children of Family Y by computed tomography (CT) scan. As Figure 2A indicates, the vestibular aqueduct is enlarged. There was no clinical evidence of thyroid abnorm-alities and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine concentrations in the four affected individuals were normal."

        "answer1": "The main idea of the paper is to investigate the genetic basis of inherited hearing loss in the Palestinian population. The study found that there is a high level of allelic and locus heterogeneity characterizing inherited hearing loss in this population, and identified multiple novel alleles for Mendelian phenotype. The study provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of hearing loss in this population, which could potentially impact the diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss.",
